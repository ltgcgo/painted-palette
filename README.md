# painted-palette
ðŸŽ¨ Painting palettes, one at a time. One single brush, multiple easels to paint on.

No additional compilation required, everything already bundled nicely into a single command/package.

If you're running it on Android with Termux, install it from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/#versions), **not Google Play**!!!

Powered by ESBuild and Deno. Developed by [Lightingale Community and all contributors](CREDITS.md).
